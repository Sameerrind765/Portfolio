# Project Name

This is a Vite-based React project.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **pnpm**

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and start the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository
If you haven’t already, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd <project-directory>
```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
```
> If you are using **pnpm**, run:
```bash
pnpm install
```

---

### 3. Build the Project
Since the project requires a production build to run, build the project first:
```bash
npm run build
```
> For **pnpm**, use:
```bash
pnpm build
```

---

### 4. Start the Project
After building the project, start the production server:
```bash
npm run preview
```
> For **pnpm**, use:
```bash
pnpm preview
```

This will start a local server, usually accessible at `http://localhost:5000`. The exact URL will be displayed in your terminal.

---

## Development Mode
If you wish to run the project in development mode, use:
```bash
npm run dev
```
> For **pnpm**, use:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

The development server will typically run at `http://localhost:5173`.

---

## Building for Deployment
To create a production-ready build, use:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will generate a `dist` folder containing optimized files for deployment.

---

## Additional Notes
- Ensure your `vite.config.js` is correctly configured for your environment.
- For troubleshooting, refer to the terminal logs or Vite’s documentation: [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/).
